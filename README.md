# VOICE CONTROLLED HOME APPLIANCES


## Project Statement


This is a project which is supposed to enable one to control home appliances by use of voice commands communicated to the Google Assistant, which then prompts the desired actions. 
In this case, we used voice commands to turn an LED on or/ and off.
This serves to make work easier, and adds convenience, since it can be done remotely.
